      <h2>  Graduate Teaching Assistant <br>
          Department of Mathematics <br>
          University of Nebraska - Lincoln 
      </h2>
      <p> I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln advised by Tom Marley. I'm interested in commutative algebra and homological algebra, and am currently working on extending concepts and
        techniques in these fields (e.g. Cohen-Macaualy and Gorenstein rings) to differential graded algebras. I received my MS in mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2023, and my BS in mathematics
        from the University of Kansas in 2020. </p>
